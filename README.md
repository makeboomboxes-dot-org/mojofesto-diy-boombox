## Project Description

At MAKEBOOMBOXES, we believe in freedom - the freedom to make and share some of the coolest boomboxes ever. By open sourcing the MOJOFESTO design, we aim to empower audio enthusiasts, DIY makers and entrepreneurs to make their own high-quality portable bluetooth speakers and adapt the design to their needs. This repository includes complete manufacturing specifications, assembly documentation, a detailed bill of materials and tools list. 

## Why make a DIY boombox?

In a distressed World that looks like we might not make it, why build something to last? When things are more disposable and people more isolated than ever, why strive for musical connection in our communities? When rising selfishness and distrust threaten to pull us apart, why put this thing together? … Yes, that’s exactly why. 

Inside every home-made boombox is a call for togetherness; proof that we can create durable, joyful, musical experiences to share. 

Behind each unique home-made high-quality boombox is a maker to show that: Yes. We can make it.

## Features

## How to Build the MOJOFESTO

Building your own MOJOFESTO boombox is an exciting project that involves basic wood-working and electronics assembly and a bit of craftsmanship. Here’s how to get started:

### Parts Needed

For an overview list of all parts needed, see the "get started" PDF in the docs folder.

Many of the parts are laser cut by you if you own or have access to a laser cutter, or they can be ordered from online laser-cut-to-order services like Panoko or Send Cut Send. The other parts are fasteners, wiring/connectors, and OEM electronics parts.

For a detailed bill of materials with links to supplier sources, see the spreadsheet file in the bom folder.

### Tools Needed

For a complete list of all tools needed, see the "get started" PDF in the docs folder.

### Time Needed

Once all parts and tools are gathered / made, the total boombox can be made in one weekend-long project, or in 5 to 6 sessions of 1 or 2 hours each. 

### Assembly Instructions

See detailed assembly guides in the docs folder of this repository. 

The milestones and steps of the build, listed below, are accomplished by performing the build tasks and quality checks documented in the assembly guides.

A. **Chassis:** Bracket tabs, ribs, frame bulkheads, corner bracings, corner curve walls, bottom wall

B. **Traction:** Feet, handle arms, handle bar

C. **Expansion:** Kill switch, amp board, charging jack, USB  out, Aux in, 3 walls, handle assembly 

D. **Soundboard:** Speaker rings, wings, battery straps and brackets, speakers, speaker covers

E. **Closure** Front borders, art face magnets, connect wiring, tidy wires, back borders

### Testing

Check off each item in the testing checklist provided at the end of each build step in the assembly guide, to ensure you're ready to move on to the next step.

## How to Operate and Customize the MOJOFESTO
